# WHACK-A-MOLE

Whack a Mole is a classic arcade game that was invented in 1976 by Aaron Fechter. The game consists of a cabinet with holes, and players use a mallet to hit toy moles that pop up randomly from the holes.

This is a submission to the Code Institute Project Portfolio 2, the aim was to create a basic yet efficient website with well-implemented JavaScript, so i decided to make a "whack-a-mole"-game with a little twist, you play as Will Smith and you slap Chris Rock that pops up.
The project was designed to be simple yet functional, making it a perfect opportunity to apply some of the **JavaScript** concepts covered in the course so far.

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future I would like to expand this game with different gameplays and add different levels of difficulties.  


## Testing 

- I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

- The page is responsive and contains all the functions across different screen sizes using the dev tools device toolbar.

- I confirmed that all of the content is readable and easy to understand.

- I confirmed that the webpage are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs
- I had some trouble when I deployed my project to Github Pages, nothing worked and it was because I had used absolute file paths.
- I had some trouble with the media queries.
- I wasn't happy with the Lighthouse result so I converted the background image from png to Webp to get a higher score in performance.

### Unfixed Bugs
- No reports of bugs.

  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcharlieapell.github.io%2Fwhack-a-mole%2F)
